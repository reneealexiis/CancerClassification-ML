Prepared by Derick Cazares, Melissa Morales, Renee Perez, and Feven Surafel

## Overview
The objective of this project is to utilize the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic Dataset for predictive analysis to improve early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we seek to develop a predictive model that can classify tumor samples as malignant or benign based on various features extracted from cell nuclei.

## Results
**Machine Learning Logistic Regression Model (94% Accuracy)**

* Class B (Benign Diagnosis)
    * Precision: 0.95, meaning that when the model predicts a benign tumor, it is correct 95% of the time.
    * Recall: 0.95, meaning that 95% of all actual benign instances were correctly identified.

* Class M (Malignant Diagnosis)
    * Precision: 0.93, meaning that when the model predicts a malignant tumor, it is correct 93% of the time.
    * Recall: 0.93, meaning that 93% of all actual malignant instances were correctly identified.

## Analysis

Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to create a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying breast cancer tumors based on features such as radius, texture, perimeter, and smoothness of cell nuclei.

Data
The data used in this analysis comes from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic Dataset and includes the following:

569 samples
30 features representing characteristics of the tumor
Target labels: Benign (B) and Malignant (M)

Machine Learning Process

1. Data Preprocessing
The dataset was cleaned and split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
2. Model Training
A Logistic Regression model was used due to its effectiveness in binary classification.
The model was trained on the training data and evaluated on the test data.
3. Evaluation Metrics
The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
The confusion matrix and ROC curve were used to assess the model's predictions and trade-offs between true positives and false positives.
4. Correlation Analysis
A correlation matrix was computed to analyze relationships between features, identifying highly correlated features, which can impact the effectiveness of the model.

## Summary
The Logistic Regression model performed well with an accuracy of 94%. It demonstrated high precision and recall for both benign and malignant tumor classifications, making it a strong candidate for this classification problem.
